            I am currently working as a Finance and Strategy Manager for a marketing company called Contend/Mosaic in Downtown Los Angeles. I am also currently enrolled in the Front End Web Development Program at General Assembly and I hope to parlay what I learn at GA into a fullfilling career as a Web Developer.
