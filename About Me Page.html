            Hi! I'm Lorenzo Patricio! I'm a DTLA resident and a true Angeleno (yes we do exist!). I was raised in Northeast San Fernando Valley in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. I have a crazy dog named Bailey Jean who is a little too smart for her own good.
         </p>

            I am currently a Finance and Strategy Manager for a marketing company in Downtown Los Angeles but I have found a new passion in front-end web developement. My goal is learn as much coding as I can so that I can keep pushing the web developement envelope and provide my clients with unparalleled service.
