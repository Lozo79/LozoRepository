        <p>Hi! I'm Lorenzo Patricio! I'm a DTLA resident and a true Angeleno (yes we do exist!). I was raised in Northeast San Fernando Valley in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. I have a crazy dog named Bailey Jean who is a little too smart for her own good.
            I'm currently a Finance and Strategy Manager for a marketing company but my goal is to be able to work remotely while I travel the world.
